In this section, we will describe how to use the Nexis Network command-line tools to create a wallet, to send and receive NZT tokens, and to participate in the cluster by delegating stake.

To interact with a Nexis Network cluster, we will use its command-line interface, also known as the CLI. We use the command-line because it is the first place the Nexis Network core team deploys new functionality. The command-line interface is not necessarily the easiest to use, but it provides the most direct, flexible, and secure access to your Nexis Network accounts.

## Getting Started

To get started using the Solana Command Line (CLI) tools:

- Install the Nexis Network Tools
- Choose a Cluster
- Create a Wallet
- Check out our CLI conventions

<GuidesOther
  id="nexis_tool_suite"
  title="Install the Nexis Network Tool Suite"
  level={2}
  isShow={false}
/>

There are multiple ways to install the Nexis Network tools on your computer depending on your preferred workflow:

- Use Nexis Network Install Tool
- MacOS & Linux
- Windows
- Download Prebuilt Binaries
- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows
- Build From Source

## Use Nexis Network Install Tool

### MacOS & Linux

- Open your favorite Terminal application
- Install the Nexis Network release LATEST_Nexis Network_RELEASE on your machine by running:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nexis-network/nexis/develop/install/nexis-network-install-init.sh | sh -s - LATEST_ENZTNETWORK_RELEASE
```

- If you are connecting to a different testnet, you can replace LATEST_ENZTNETWORK_RELEASE with the release tag matching the software version of your desired testnet, or replace it with the named channel stable, beta, or edge.
- The following output indicates a successful update:

```bash {{ title: '' }}
looking for latest release downloading LATEST_ENZTNETWORK_RELEASE installer
Configuration: /home/nexis-network/.config/nexis-network/install/config.yml
Active release directory: /home/nexis-network/.local/share/nexis-network/install/active_release
```

- Release version: LATEST_ENZTNETWORK_RELEASE
- Release URL: https://github.com/nexis-network/nexis/releases/download/LATEST_ENZTNETWORK_RELEASE/nexis-network-release-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.bz2 {{className: 'break-words'}}

### Update successful

- Depending on your system, the end of the installer messaging may prompt you to

Please update your PATH environment variable to include the Nexis Network programs:

- If you get the above message, copy and paste the recommended command below it to update `PATH`

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
export PATH="/root/.local/share/nexis-network/install/active_release/bin:$PATH" to bashrc
```

- Confirm you have the desired version of `nexis-network` installed by running:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis --version
```

- After a successful install, `nexis-network-install update` may be used to easily update the Nexis Network software to a newer version at any time.

curl -L https://github.com/nexis-network/nexis/releases/download/v0.5.1/nexis-network-install-init-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe --output C:\nexis-install-tmp\nexis-install-init.exe --create-dirs
```

- Copy and paste the following command, then press Enter to install the latest stable version of Nexis Network. If you see a security pop-up by your system, please select to allow the program to run.

C:\nexis-install-tmp\nexis-install-init.exe stable

- When the installer is finished, press Enter.
- Close the command prompt window and re-open a new command prompt window as a normal user
- Search for "Command Prompt" in the search bar, then left click on the Command Prompt app icon, no need to run as Administrator)
- Confirm you have the desired version of `nexis` installed by entering:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis --version
```

- After a successful install, `nexis-install update` may be used to easily update the Nexis Network software to a newer version at any time.

## Download Prebuilt Binaries

If you would rather not use nexis-install to manage the install, you can manually download and install the binaries.

### Linux

Download the binaries by navigating to https://github.com/nexis-network/nexis/releases/latest, download nexis-network-release-x86_64-unknown-linux-msvc.tar.bz2, then extract the archive: {{ className: 'break-words'}}

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}

cd nexis-release/
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

### MacOS

Download the binaries by navigating to https://github.com/nexis-network/nexis/releases/latest, download nexis-network-release-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.bz2, then extract the archive:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
tar jxf nexis-release-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.bz2
cd nexis-release/
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

### Windows

- Download the binaries by navigating to https://github.com/nexis-network/nexis/releases/latest, download nexis-network-release-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.tar.bz2, then extract the archive using WinZip or similar. {{ className: 'break-words'}}
- Open a Command Prompt and navigate to the directory into which you extracted the binaries and run:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
cd nexis-release/
set PATH=%cd%/bin;%PATH%
```

## Build From Source

If you are unable to use the prebuilt binaries or prefer to build it yourself from source, navigate to https://github.com/nexis-network/nexis/releases/latest, and download the Source Code archive. Extract the code and build the binaries with:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
./scripts/cargo-install-all.sh .
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

  title="Using Nexis Network CLI"
  level={2}
  isShow={false}
/>

Before running any Nexis Network CLI commands, let's go over some conventions that you will see across all commands. First, the Nexis Network CLI is actually a collection of different commands for each action you might want to take. You can view the list of all possible commands by running:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis --help
```

To zoom in on how to use a particular command, run:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis <COMMAND> --help
```

where you replace the text `<COMMAND>` with the name of the command you want to learn more about.

The command's usage message will typically contain words such as `<AMOUNT>`, `<ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>` or `<KEYPAIR>`. Each word is a placeholder for the type of text you can execute the command with. For example, you can replace `<AMOUNT>` with a number such as `42` or `100.42`. You can replace `<ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>` with the base58 encoding of your public key, such as `9grmKMwTiZwUHSExjtbFzHLPTdWoXgcg1bZkhvwTrTww`.

## Keypair conventions

Many commands using the CLI tools require a value for a `<KEYPAIR>`. The value you should use for the keypair depend on what type of command line wallet you created.

For example, the way to display any wallet's address (also known as the keypair's pubkey), the CLI help document shows:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis-keygen pubkey <KEYPAIR>
```

Below, we show how to resolve what you should put in `<KEYPAIR>` depending on your wallet type.

### Paper Wallet

In a paper wallet, the keypair is securely derived from the seed words and optional passphrase you entered when the wallet was create. To use a paper wallet keypair anywhere the `<KEYPAIR>` text is shown in examples or help documents, enter the word `ASK` and the program will prompt you to enter your seed words when you run the command.

To display the wallet address of a Paper Wallet:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis-keygen pubkey ASK
```

### File System Wallet

With a file system wallet, the keypair is stored in a file on your computer. Replace `<KEYPAIR>` with the complete file path to the keypair file.

For example, if the file system keypair file location is /home/nexis/my_wallet.json, to display the address, do:

Copy

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis-keygen pubkey /home/nexis/my_wallet.json
```

  title="Connecting to a Cluster"
  level={2}
  isShow={false}
/>

See Nexis Network Clusters for general information about the available clusters.

## Configure the command-line tool

You can check what cluster the Nexis Network command-line tool (CLI) is currently targeting by running the following command:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis config get
```

Use nexis config set command to target a particular cluster. After setting a cluster target, any future subcommands will send/receive information from that cluster.

For example to target the Devnet cluster, run:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis config set --url https://rpc-test-1.nexis.network
```

## Ensure Versions Match

Though not strictly necessary, the CLI will generally work best when its version matches the software version running on the cluster. To get the locally-installed CLI version, run:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis --version
```

To get the cluster version, run:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis cluster-version
```

Ensure the local CLI version is greater than or equal to the cluster version.

  title="Send and Receive Tokens"
  level={2}

This page decribes how to receive and send NZT tokens using the command line tools with a command line wallet such as a paper wallet, and a file system wallet. Before you begin, make sure you have created a wallet and have access to its address (pubkey) and the signing keypair. Check out our conventions for entering keypairs for different wallet types.

## Testing your Wallet

Before sharing your public key with others, you may want to first ensure the key is valid and that you indeed hold the corresponding private key.

In this example, we will create a second wallet in addition to your first wallet, and then transfer some tokens to it. This will confirm that you can send and receive tokens on your wallet type of choice.

This test example uses our Developer Testnet, called devnet. Tokens issued on devnet have no value, so don't worry if you lose them.

### Airdrop some tokens to get started

First, airdrop yourself some play tokens on the devnet.

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis airdrop 10 <RECIPIENT_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> --url https://rpc-test-1.nexis.network
```

where you replace the text `<RECIPIENT_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>` with your base58-encoded public key/wallet address.

### Check your balance

Confirm the airdrop was successful by checking the account's balance. It should output `10 NZT`:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis balance <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> --url https://rpc-test-1.nexis.network
```

### Create a second wallet address

We will need a new address to receive our tokens. Create a second keypair and record its pubkey:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis -keygen new --no-passphrase --no-outfile
```

The output will contain the address after the text `pubkey:`.

Copy the address. We will use it in the next step.

```bash {{ title: '' }}
pubkey: GKvqsuNcnwWqPzzuhLmGi4rzzh55FhJtGizkhHaEJqiV
```

You can also create a second (or more) wallet of any type: paper, file system.

### Transfer tokens from your first wallet to the second address

Next, prove that you own the airdropped tokens by transferring them. The Nexis Network cluster will only accept the transfer if you sign the transaction with the private keypair corresponding to the sender's public key in the transaction.

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis transfer --from <KEYPAIR> <RECIPIENT_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> 5 --url https://rpc-test-1.nexis.network --fee-payer <KEYPAIR>
```

where you replace `<KEYPAIR>` with the path to a keypair in your first wallet, and replace `<RECIPIENT_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>` with the address of your second wallet.

Confirm the updated balances with `nexis balance`:

nexis balance `<ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> --url  https://rpc-test-1.nexis.network`

where `<ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>` is either the public key from your keypair or the recipient's public key.

5 NZT  # The second wallet has now received the 5 NZT transfer from the first wallet
```

## Receive Tokens

To receive tokens, you will need an address for others to send tokens to. In Nexis Network, the wallet address is the public key of a keypair. There are a variety of techniques for generating keypairs. The method you choose will depend on how you choose to store keypairs. Keypairs are stored in wallets. Before receiving tokens, you will need to create a wallet. Once completed, you should have a public key for each keypair you generated. The public key is a long string of base58 characters. Its length varies from 32 to 44 characters.

## Send Tokens

If you already hold NZT and want to send tokens to someone, you will need a path to your keypair, their base58-encoded public key, and a number of tokens to transfer. Once you have that collected, you can transfer tokens with the nexis transfer command:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis transfer --from <KEYPAIR> <RECIPIENT_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT> --fee-payer <KEYPAIR>
```

Confirm the updated balances with `nexis balance`:

Copy

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis balance <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
```

<GuidesOther
  id="delegate_stake"
  title="Delegate Stake"
  level={2}
  isShow={false}
/>

After you have received NZT, you might consider putting it to use by delegating stake to a validator. Stake is what we call tokens in a stake account. Nexis Network weights validator votes by the amount of stake delegated to them, which gives those validators more influence in determining then next valid block of transactions in the blockchain. Nexis Network then generates new NZT periodically to reward stakers and validators. You earn more rewards the more stake you delegate.

## Create a Stake Account

To delegate stake, you will need to transfer some tokens into a stake account. To create an account, you will need a keypair. Its public key will be used as the stake account address. No need for a password or encryption here; this keypair will be discarded right after creating the stake account.

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis-network-keygen new --no-passphrase -o stake-account.json
```

The output will contain the public key after the text `pubkey:`.

```bash {{ title: '' }}
pubkey: GKvqsuNcnwWqPzzuhLmGi4rzzh55FhJtGizkhHaEJqiV
```

Copy the public key and store it for safekeeping. You will need it any time you want to perform an action on the stake account you create next.

Now, create a stake account:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis create-stake-account --from <KEYPAIR> stake-account.json <AMOUNT> \
--stake-authority <KEYPAIR> --withdraw-authority <KEYPAIR> \
--fee-payer <KEYPAIR>
```

`<AMOUNT>` tokens are transferred from the account at the "from" `<KEYPAIR>` to a new stake account at the public key of stake-account.json.

The stake-account.json file can now be discarded. To authorize additional actions, you will use the `--stake-authority` or `--withdraw-authority` keypair, not stake-account.json.

View the new stake account with the nexis stake-account command:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis stake-account <STAKE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
```

The output will look similar to this:

```bash {{ title: '' }}
Total Stake: 5000 NZT
Stake account is undelegated
Stake Authority: EXU95vqs93yPeCeAU7mPPu6HbRUmTFPEiGug9oCdvQ5F
Withdraw Authority: EXU95vqs93yPeCeAU7mPPu6HbRUmTFPEiGug9oCdvQ5F
```

### Set Stake and Withdraw Authorities

Stake and withdraw authorities can be set when creating an account via the `--stake-authority` and `--withdraw-authority` options, or afterward with the `nexis stake-authorize` command. For example, to set a new stake authority, run:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis stake-authorize <STAKE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> \
--stake-authority <KEYPAIR> --new-stake-authority <PUBKEY> \
--fee-payer <KEYPAIR>
```

This will use the existing stake authority `<KEYPAIR>` to authorize a new stake authority `<PUBKEY>` on the stake account `<STAKE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>`.

### Advanced: Derive Stake Account Addresses

When you delegate stake, you delegate all tokens in the stake account to a single validator. To delegate to multiple validators, you will need multiple stake accounts. Creating a new keypair for each account and managing those addresses can be cumbersome. Fortunately, you can derive stake addresses using the `--seed` option:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis create-stake-account --from <KEYPAIR> <STAKE_ACCOUNT_KEYPAIR> --seed <STRING> <AMOUNT> \
--stake-authority <PUBKEY> --withdraw-authority <PUBKEY> --fee-payer <KEYPAIR>
```

`<STRING>` is an arbitrary string up to 32 bytes, but will typically be a number corresponding to which derived account this is. The first account might be "0", then "1", and so on. The public key of `<STAKE_ACCOUNT_KEYPAIR>` acts as the base address. The command derives a new address from the base address and seed string. To see what stake address the command will derive, use `nexis create-address-with-seed`:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis create-address-with-seed --from <PUBKEY> <SEED_STRING> STAKE
```

`<PUBKEY>` is the public key of the `<STAKE_ACCOUNT_KEYPAIR>` passed to nexis `create-stake-account`.

## Delegate Stake

To delegate your stake to a validator, you will need its vote account address. Find it by querying the cluster for the list of all validators and their vote accounts with the `nexis validators` command:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis validators
```

The first column of each row contains the validator's identity and the second is the vote account address. Choose a validator and use its vote account address in `nexis delegate-stake`:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis delegate-stake --stake-authority <KEYPAIR> <STAKE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> <VOTE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> \
--fee-payer <KEYPAIR>
```

The stake authority `<KEYPAIR>` authorizes the operation on the account with address `<STAKE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>`. The stake is delegated to the vote account with address `<VOTE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>`.

After delegating stake, use `nexis stake-account` to observe the changes to the stake account:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis stake-account <STAKE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
```

You will see new fields "Delegated Stake" and "Delegated Vote Account Address" in the output. The output will look similar to this:

```bash {{ title: '' }}
Total Stake: 5000 NZT
Credits Observed: 147462
Delegated Stake: 4999.99771712 NZT
Delegated Vote Account Address: CcaHc2L43ZWjwCHART3oZoJvHLAe9hzT2DJNUpBzoTN1
Stake activates starting from epoch: 42
Stake Authority: EXU95vqs93yPeCeAU7mPPu6HbRUmTFPEiGug9oCdvQ5F
Withdraw Authority: EXU95vqs93yPeCeAU7mPPu6HbRUmTFPEiGug9oCdvQ5F
```

## Deactivate Stake

Once delegated, you can undelegate stake with the `nexis deactivate-stake` command:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis deactivate-stake --stake-authority <KEYPAIR> <STAKE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> \
--fee-payer <KEYPAIR>
```

The stake authority `<KEYPAIR>` authorizes the operation on the account with address `<STAKE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>`.

Note that stake takes several epochs to "cool down". Attempts to delegate stake in the cool down period will fail.

## Withdraw Stake

Transfer tokens out of a stake account with the `nexis withdraw-stake` command:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis withdraw-stake --withdraw-authority <KEYPAIR> <STAKE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT> \
--fee-payer <KEYPAIR>
```

`<STAKE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>` is the existing stake account, the stake authority `<KEYPAIR>` is the withdraw authority, and `<AMOUNT>` is the number of tokens to transfer to `<RECIPIENT_ADDRESS>`.

## Split Stake

You may want to delegate stake to additional validators while your existing stake is not eligible for withdrawal. It might not be eligible because it is currently staked, cooling down, or locked up. To transfer tokens from an existing stake account to a new one, use the `nexis split-stake` command:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis split-stake --stake-authority <KEYPAIR> <STAKE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> <NEW_STAKE_ACCOUNT_KEYPAIR> <AMOUNT> \
--fee-payer <KEYPAIR>
```

`<STAKE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>` is the existing stake account, the stake authority `<KEYPAIR>` is the stake authority, `<NEW_STAKE_ACCOUNT_KEYPAIR>` is the keypair for the new account, and `<AMOUNT>` is the number of tokens to transfer to the new account.

To split a stake account into a derived account address, use the `--seed` option. See Derive Stake Account Addresses for details.

  title="Manage Stake Accounts"
  level={2}
  isShow={false}
/>

If you want to delegate stake to many different validators, you will need to create a separate stake account for each. If you follow the convention of creating the first stake account at seed "0", the second at "1", the third at "2", and so on, then the `nexis-network-stake-accounts` tool will allow you to operate on all accounts with single invocations. You can use it to sum up the balances of all accounts, move accounts to a new wallet, or set new authorities.

## Usage

### Create a stake account

Create and fund a derived stake account at the stake authority public key:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis-network-stake-accounts new <FUNDING_KEYPAIR> <BASE_KEYPAIR> <AMOUNT> \
--stake-authority <PUBKEY> --withdraw-authority <PUBKEY> \
--fee-payer <KEYPAIR>
```

### Count accounts

Count the number of derived accounts:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis-network-stake-accounts count <BASE_PUBKEY>
```

### Get stake account balances

Sum the balance of derived stake accounts:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis-network-stake-accounts balance <BASE_PUBKEY> --num-accounts <NUMBER>
```

### Get stake account addresses

List the address of each stake account derived from the given public key:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis-network-stake-accounts addresses <BASE_PUBKEY> --num-accounts <NUMBER>
```

### Set new authorities

Set new authorities on each derived stake account:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis-network-stake-accounts authorize <BASE_PUBKEY> \
--stake-authority <KEYPAIR> --withdraw-authority <KEYPAIR> \
--new-stake-authority <PUBKEY> --new-withdraw-authority <PUBKEY> \
--num-accounts <NUMBER> --fee-payer <KEYPAIR>
```

### Relocate stake accounts

Relocate stake accounts:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis-network-stake-accounts rebase <BASE_PUBKEY> <NEW_BASE_KEYPAIR> \
--stake-authority <KEYPAIR> --num-accounts <NUMBER> \
--fee-payer <KEYPAIR>
```

To atomically rebase and authorize each stake account, use the 'move' command:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis-network-stake-accounts move <BASE_PUBKEY> <NEW_BASE_KEYPAIR> \
--stake-authority <KEYPAIR> --withdraw-authority <KEYPAIR> \
--new-stake-authority <PUBKEY> --new-withdraw-authority <PUBKEY> \
--num-accounts <NUMBER> --fee-payer <KEYPAIR>
```

Developers can deploy on-chain programs (often called smart contracts elsewhere) with the Nexis Network tools.

To learn about developing and executing programs on Nexis Network, start with the overview and then dig into the details of on-chain programs.

To deploy a program, use the Nexis Network tools to interact with the on-chain loader to:

- Initialize a program account
- Upload the program's shared object to the program account's data buffer
- Verify the uploaded program
- Finalize the program by marking the program account executable.
- Once deployed, anyone can execute the program by sending transactions that reference it to the cluster.

## Usage

### Deploy a program

To deploy a program, you will need the location of the program's shared object (the program binary .so)

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis program deploy <PROGRAM_FILEPATH>
```

Successful deployment will return the program id of the deployed program, for example:

```bash {{ title: '' }}
Program Id: 3KS2k14CmtnuVv2fvYcvdrNgC94Y11WETBpMUGgXyWZL
```

Specify the keypair in the deploy command to deploy to a specific program id:

```bash {{ title: '' }}
nexis program deploy --program-id <KEYPAIR_FILEPATH> <PROGRAM_FILEPATH>
```

If the program id is not specified on the command line the tools will first look for a keypair file matching the `<PROGRAM_FILEPATH>`, or internally generate a new keypair.

A matching program keypair file is in the same directory as the program's shared object, and named `<PROGRAM_NAME>-keypair.json`. Matching program keypairs are generated automatically by the program build tools:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
./path-to-program/program.so
./path-to-program/program-keypair.json
```

### Showing a program account

To get information about a deployed program:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis program show <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
```

An example output looks like:

```bash {{ title: '' }}
Program Id: 3KS2k14CmtnuVv2fvYcvdrNgC94Y11WETBpMUGgXyWZL
Owner: BPFLoaderUpgradeab1e11111111111111111111111
ProgramData Address: EHsACWBhgmw8iq5dmUZzTA1esRqcTognhKNHUkPi4q4g
Authority: FwoGJNUaJN2zfVEex9BB11Dqb3NJKy3e9oY3KTh9XzCU
Last Deployed In Slot: 63890568
Data Length: 5216 (0x1460) bytes
```

- `Program Id` is the address that can be referenced in an instruction's `program_id` field when invoking a program.
- `Owner`: The loader this program was deployed with.
- `ProgramData Address` is the account associated with the program account that holds the program's data (shared object).
- `Authority` is the program's upgrade authority.
- `Last Deployed` In Slot is the slot in which the program was last deployed.
- `Data Length` is the size of the space reserved for deployments. The actual space used by the currently deployed program may be less.

### Redeploy a program

A program can be redeployed to the same address to facilitate rapid development, bug fixes, or upgrades. Matching keypair files are generated once so that redeployments will be to the same program address.

The command looks the same as the deployment command:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis program deploy <PROGRAM_FILEPATH>
```

By default, programs are deployed to accounts that are twice the size of the original deployment. Doing so leaves room for program growth in future redeployments. But, if the initially deployed program is very small (like a simple helloworld program) and then later grows substantially, the redeployment may fail. To avoid this, specify a `max_len` that is at least the size (in bytes) that the program is expected to become (plus some wiggle room).

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis program deploy --max-len 200000 <PROGRAM_FILEPATH>
```

Note that program accounts are required to be rent-exempt, and the `max-len` is fixed after initial deployment, so any NZT in the program accounts is locked up permanently.

### Resuming a failed deploy

If program deployment fails, there will be a hanging intermediate buffer account that contains a non-zero balance. In order to recoup that balance you may resume a failed deployment by providing the same intermediate buffer to a new call to deploy.

Deployment failures will print an error message specifying the seed phrase needed to recover the generated intermediate buffer's keypair:

```bash {{ title: '' }}
==================================================================================
Recover the intermediate accounts ephemeral keypair file with
nexis-network-keygen recover and the following 12-word seed phrase:
==================================================================================
valley flat great hockey share token excess clever benefit traffic avocado athlete
==================================================================================
To resume a deploy, pass the recovered keypair as
the [PROGRAM_ADDRESS_SIGNER] argument to nexis deploy or
as the [BUFFER_SIGNER] to nexis program deploy or nexis write-buffer.
Or to recover the accounts lamports, pass it as the
[BUFFER_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS] argument to nexis program drain.
==================================================================================
```

To recover the keypair:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis-network-keygen recover -o <KEYPAIR_PATH>
```

When asked, enter the 12-word seed phrase.

Then issue a new deploy command and specify the buffer:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis program deploy --buffer <KEYPAIR_PATH> <PROGRAM_FILEPATH>
```

### Closing buffer accounts and reclaiming their lamports

If deployment fails there will be a left over buffer account that holds lamports. The buffer account can either be used to resume a deploy or closed. When closed, the full balance of the buffer account will be transferred to the recipient's account.

The buffer account's authority must be present to close a buffer account, to list all the open buffer accounts that match the default authority:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis program show --buffers
```

To specify a different authority:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis program show --buffers --buffer-authority <AURTHORITY_ADRESS>
```

To close a single account:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis program close <BUFFER_ADDRESS>
```

To close a single account and specify a different authority than the default:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis program close <BUFFER_ADDRESS> --buffer-authority <KEYPAIR_FILEPATH>
```

To close a single account and specify a different recipient than the default:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis program close <BUFFER_ADDRESS> --recipient <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS>
```

To close all the buffer accounts associated with the current authority:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis program close --buffers
```

To show all buffer accounts regardless of the authority

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis program show --buffers --all
```

### Set a program's upgrade authority

The program's upgrade authority must to be present to deploy a program. If no authority is specified during program deployment, the default keypair is used as the authority. This is why redeploying a program in the steps above didn't require an authority to be explicitly specified.

The authority can be specified during deployment:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis program deploy --upgrade-authority <UPGRADE_AUTHORITY_SIGNER> <PROGRAM_FILEPATH>
```

Or after deployment and using the default keypair as the current authority:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis program set-upgrade-authority <PROGRAM_ADDRESS> --new-upgrade-authority <NEW_UPGRADE_AUTHORITY>
```

Or after deployment and specifying the current authority:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis program set-upgrade-authority <PROGRAM_ADDRESS> --upgrade-authority <UPGRADE_AUTHORITY_SIGNER> --new-upgrade-authority <NEW_UPGRADE_AUTHORITY>
```

### Immutable programs

A program can be marked immutable, which prevents all further redeployments, by specifying the `--final` flag during deployment:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis program deploy <PROGRAM_FILEPATH> --final
```

Or anytime after:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis program set-upgrade-authority <PROGRAM_ADDRESS> --final
```

`nexis program deploy ...` utilizes Exno Network’s upgradeable loader, but there is another way to deploy immutable programs using the original on-chain loader:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis deploy <PROGRAM_FILEPATH>
```

Programs deployed with `nexis deploy ...` are not redeployable and are not compatible with the `nexis program ...` commands.

### Dumping a program to a file

The deployed program may be dumped back to a local file:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis program dump <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> <OUTPUT_FILEPATH>
```

The dumped file will be in the same as what was deployed, so in the case of a shared object, the dumped file will be a fully functional shared object. Note that the `dump` command dumps the entire data space, which means the output file will have trailing zeros after the shared object's data up to `max_len`. Sometimes it is useful to dump and compare a program to ensure it matches a known program binary. The original program file can be zero-extended, hashed, and compared to the hash of the dumped file.

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
$ nexis dump <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> dump.so
$ cp original.so extended.so
$ truncate -r dump.so extended.so
$ sha256sum extended.so dump.so
```

### Using an intermediary Buffer account

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
$ nexis dump <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> dump.so
$ cp original.so extended.so
$ truncate -r dump.so extended.so
$ sha256sum extended.so dump.so
```

Instead of deploying directly to the program account, the program can be written to an intermediary buffer account. Intermediary accounts can useful for things like multi-entity governed programs where the governing members fist verify the intermediary buffer contents and then vote to allow an upgrade using it.

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis program write-buffer <PROGRAM_FILEPATH>
```

Buffer accounts support authorities like program accounts:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis program set-buffer-authority <BUFFER_ADDRESS> --new-upgrade-authority <NEW_UPGRADE_AUTHORITY>
```

One exception is that buffer accounts cannot be marked immutable like program accounts can, so they don't support `--final`.

The buffer account, once entirely written, can be passed to `deploy` to deploy the program:

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis program deploy --program-id <PROGRAM_ADDRESS> --buffer <BUFFER_ADDRESS>
```

Note, the buffer's authority must match the program's upgrade authority.

Buffers also support `show` and `dump` just like programs do.

  id="transaction_signing"
  title="Offline Transaction Signing"
  level={2}
  isShow={false}
/>

Some security models require keeping signing keys, and thus the signing process, separated from transaction creation and network broadcast. Examples include:

- Collecting signatures from geographically disparate signers in a multi-signature scheme
- Signing transactions using an airgapped signing device

This document describes using Nexis Network CLI to separately sign and submit a transaction.

## Commands Supporting Offline Signing

At present, the following commands support offline signing:

<ResourcesOther
  id="elements"
  title=""
  level={2}
  elements={elements}
  isHeading={false}
/>

## Signing Transactions Offline

To sign a transaction offline, pass the following arguments on the command line

1. `--sign-only`, prevents the client from submitting the signed transaction to the network. Instead, the pubkey/signature pairs are printed to stdout.

2. ` --blockhash BASE58_HASH`, allows the caller to specify the value used to fill the transaction's `recent_blockhash` field. This serves a number of purposes, namely: Eliminates the need to connect to the network and query a recent blockhash via RPC Enables the signers to coordinate the blockhash in a multiple-signature scheme.

### Example: Offline Signing a Payment

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis-network@offline$ nexis transfer --sign-only --blockhash 5Tx8F3jgSHx21CbtjwmdaKPLM5tWmreWAnPrbqHomSJF \
 recipient-keypair.json 1
```

```json {{ title: 'Output' }}
Blockhash: 5Tx8F3jgSHx21CbtjwmdaKPLM5tWmreWAnPrbqHomSJF
Signers (Pubkey=Signature):
FhtzLVsmcV7S5XqGD79ErgoseCLhZYmEZnz9kQg1Rp7j=4vC38p4bz7XyiXrk6HtaooUqwxTWKocf45cstASGtmrD398biNJnmTcUCVEojE7wVQvgdYbjHJqRFZPpzfCQpmUN

{"blockhash":"5Tx8F3jgSHx21CbtjwmdaKPLM5tWmreWAnPrbqHomSJF","signers":["FhtzLVsmcV7S5XqGD79ErgoseCLhZYmEZnz9kQg1Rp7j=4vC38p4bz7XyiXrk6HtaooUqwxTWKocf45cstASGtmrD398biNJnmTcUCVEojE7wVQvgdYbjHJqRFZPpzfCQpmUN"]}
```

## Submitting Offline Signed Transactions to the Network

To submit a transaction that has been signed offline to the network, pass the following arguments on the command line

1. `--blockhash BASE58_HASH`, must be the same blockhash as was used to sign

2. `--signer BASE58_PUBKEY=BASE58_SIGNATURE`, one for each offline signer. This includes the pubkey/signature pairs directly in the transaction rather than signing it with any local keypair(s)

### Example: Submitting an Offline Signed Payment

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis-network@online$ nexis transfer --blockhash 5Tx8F3jgSHx21CbtjwmdaKPLM5tWmreWAnPrbqHomSJF \
--signer FhtzLVsmcV7S5XqGD79ErgoseCLhZYmEZnz9kQg1Rp7j=4vC38p4bz7XyiXrk6HtaooUqwxTWKocf45cstASGtmrD398biNJnmTcUCVEojE7wVQvgdYbjHJqRFZPpzfCQpmUN
recipient-keypair.json 1
```

```bash {{ title: 'Output' }}
4vC38p4bz7XyiXrk6HtaooUqwxTWKocf45cstASGtmrD398biNJnmTcUCVEojE7wVQvgdYbjHJqRFZPpzfCQpmUN
```

## Offline Signing Over Multiple Sessions

Offline signing can also take place over multiple sessions. In this scenario, pass the absent signer's public key for each role. All pubkeys that were specified, but no signature was generated for will be listed as absent in the offline signing output

### Example: Transfer with Two Offline Signing Sessions

```bash {{ title: 'Command (Offline Session #1)' }}
nexis-network@offline1 nexis transfer Fdri24WUGtrCXZ55nXiewAj6RM18hRHPGAjZk3o6vBut 10 \

## Buying More Time to Sign

Typically a Nexis Network transaction must be signed and accepted by the network within a number of slots from the blockhash in its `recent_blockhash` field (~2min at the time of this writing). If your signing procedure takes longer than this, a Durable Transaction Nonce can give you the extra time you need.

<GuidesOther
  id="transaction_nonces"
  title="Durable Transaction Nonces"
  level={2}
  isShow={false}
/>

Durable transaction nonces are a mechanism for getting around the typical short lifetime of a transaction's `recent_blockhash`.

## Usage Examples

Full usage details for durable nonce CLI commands can be found in the CLI reference.

### Nonce Authority

Authority over a nonce account can optionally be assigned to another account. In doing so the new authority inherits full control over the nonce account from the previous authority, including the account creator. This feature enables the creation of more complex account ownership arrangements and derived account addresses not associated with a keypair. The `--nonce-authority <AUTHORITY_KEYPAIR>` argument is used to specify this account and is supported by the following commands

- create-nonce-account
- new-nonce
- withdraw-from-nonce-account
- authorize-nonce-account

### Nonce Account Creation

The durable transaction nonce feature uses an account to store the next nonce value. Durable nonce accounts must be rent-exempt, so need to carry the minimum balance to achieve this.

A nonce account is created by first generating a new keypair, then create the account on chain

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis-network-keygen new -o nonce-keypair.json
nexis create-nonce-account nonce-keypair.json 1
```

```bash {{ title: 'Output' }}
2SymGjGV4ksPdpbaqWFiDoBz8okvtiik4KE9cnMQgRHrRLySSdZ6jrEcpPifW4xUpp4z66XM9d9wM48sA7peG2XL
```

To keep the keypair entirely offline, use the Paper Wallet keypair generation instructions instead.

Full usage documentation

### Querying the Stored Nonce Value

Creating a durable nonce transaction requires passing the stored nonce value as the value to the `--blockhash` argument upon signing and submission. Obtain the presently stored nonce value with

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis nonce nonce-keypair.json
```

```bash {{ title: 'Output' }}
8GRipryfxcsxN8mAGjy8zbFo9ezaUsh47TsPzmZbuytU
```

### Advancing the Stored Nonce Value

While not typically needed outside a more useful transaction, the stored nonce value can be advanced by

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis new-nonce nonce-keypair.json
```

```bash {{ title: 'Output' }}
44jYe1yPKrjuYDmoFTdgPjg8LFpYyh1PFKJqm5SC1PiSyAL8iw1bhadcAX1SL7KDmREEkmHpYvreKoNv6fZgfvUK
```

Full usage documentation

### Display Nonce Account

Inspect a nonce account in a more human friendly format with

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis nonce-account nonce-keypair.json
```

```bash {{ title: 'Output' }}
balance: 0.5 NZT
minimum balance required: 0.00136416 NZT
nonce: DZar6t2EaCFQTbUP4DHKwZ1wT8gCPW2aRfkVWhydkBvS
```

### Withdraw Funds from a Nonce Account

Withdraw funds from a nonce account with

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
nexis withdraw-from-nonce-account nonce-keypair.json ~/.config/nexis-network/id.json 0.5
```

```bash {{ title: 'Output' }}

## Other Commands Supporting Durable Nonces

To make use of durable nonces with other CLI subcommands, two arguments must be supported.

- `--nonce`, specifies the account storing the nonce value
- `--nonce-authority`, specifies an optional nonce authority

The following subcommands have received this treatment so far

- `pay`
- `delegate-stake`
- `deactivate-stake`

### Example Pay Using Durable Nonce

Here we demonstrate Alice paying Bob 1 NZT using a durable nonce. The procedure is the same for all subcommands supporting durable nonces

### Create accounts

First we need some accounts for Alice, Alice's nonce and Bob

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
$ nexis-network-keygen new -o alice.json

$ nexis-network-keygen new -o nonce.json

$ nexis-network-keygen new -o bob.json
```

### Fund Alice's account

Alice will need some funds to create a nonce account and send to Bob. Airdrop her some NZT

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
$ nexis airdrop -k alice.json 1
1 NZT
```

### Create Alice's nonce account

Now Alice needs a nonce account. Create one

Here, no separate nonce authority is employed, so `alice.json` has full authority over the nonce account

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
$ nexis create-nonce-account -k alice.json nonce.json 0.1
3KPZr96BTsL3hqera9up82KAU462Gz31xjqJ6eHUAjF935Yf8i1kmfEbo6SVbNaACKE5z6gySrNjVRvmS8DcPuwV
```

### A failed first attempt to pay Bob

Alice attempts to pay Bob, but takes too long to sign. The specified blockhash expires and the transaction fails

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
$ nexis pay -k alice.json --blockhash expiredDTaxfagttWjQweib42b6ZHADSx94Tw8gHx3W7 bob.json 0.01
[2020-01-02T18:48:28.462911000Z ERROR nexis-network_cli::cli] Io(Custom { kind: Other, error: "Transaction \"33gQQaoPc9jWePMvDAeyJpcnSPiGUAdtVg8zREWv4GiKjkcGNufgpcbFyRKRrA25NkgjZySEeKue5rawyeH5TzsV\" failed: None" })

```

### Nonce to the rescue!

Alice retries the transaction, this time specifying her nonce account and the blockhash stored there

Remember, `alice.json` is the nonce authority in this example

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
$ nexis nonce-account nonce.json

balance: 0.1 NZT
minimum balance required: 0.00136416 NZT
nonce: F7vmkY3DTaxfagttWjQweib42b6ZHADSx94Tw8gHx3W7
$ nexis pay -k alice.json --blockhash F7vmkY3DTaxfagttWjQweib42b6ZHADSx94Tw8gHx3W7 --nonce nonce.json bob.json 0.01
HR1368UKHVZyenmH7yVz5sBAijV6XAPeWbEiXEGVYQorRMcoijeNAbzZqEZiH8cDB8tk65ckqeegFjK8dHwNFgQ
```

### Success!

The transaction succeeds! Bob receives 0.01 NZT from Alice and Alice's stored nonce advances to a new value

```bash {{ title: 'Command' }}
$ nexis balance -k bob.json
0.01 NZT
Copy
$ nexis nonce-account nonce.json
balance: 0.1 NZT
minimum balance required: 0.00136416 NZT
nonce: 6bjroqDcZgTv6Vavhqf81oBHTv3aMnX19UTB51YhAZnN
